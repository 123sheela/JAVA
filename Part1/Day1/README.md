# Java Learning - Day 1

## Welcome to this Day 1 directory!

- In this directory, I'm gonna tell you about the Java Programming Language from Scratch.

# Let's Begin!ðŸš€

### What is JAVA?

- Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms.
- Java was developed in **Sun Microsystems( which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995**.
- **James Gosling** is known as the **Father of Java**.
- It is an **high level, robust, object-oriented and Secure Programming Language**.

### Features of JAVA

**1.Simple to Code & Easy to Understand**
> Java is very easy to learn and it's syntax is simple, clean and easy to Understand. According to Sun Microsystems, Java language is a simple programming language.

> Because: Java syntax is based on C++ ( so it is easier for programmers to learn it after C++).

> Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for ex: Explicit pointers, Operator overloading,etc.

> It has the feature of Automatic Garbage collection.

**2.Object-Oriented**
> Java is an Object-Oriented programming language, Everything in Java is an Object.

> Object-Oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behaviour.

**3.Platform Independent**
> Java is Platform independent because it is different from other languages like C, C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a **Write Once, Run Anywhere** Language.

> A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

**4.Secure**
> Java is best known for its Security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems, Java is secured because:
- No explicit Pointers
- Java Programs run inside a **Virtual Machine Sandbox**.
  
**5. Robust**
> Java is Robust because :
 - It uses Strong Memory Management.
 - There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.
 - Java provides **Automatic Garbage collection** which runs on the Virtual Machine to get rid of Objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.

**6.Portable**
>Java is Portable because :
 - It facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.
 - It doesn't require any implementation.
   
**7.High-Performance**
> Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because:
- Java bytecode is close to native code.
  
**8.Distributed**
> Java is distributed because:
- It facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java.
  
**9.Multi-threaded**
> A Thread is like a seperate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining Multiple threads.

**10.Dynamic**
> Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C & C++.

### Applications of JAVA

**1.Desktop Applications**
- Acrobat Reader
