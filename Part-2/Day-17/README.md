# Java Learning - Day 17

## Welcome to this Day-17 directory!

>  In this direcory, I've explained about **What is Inheritance** in Java.

## Inheritance 

Inheritance can be defined as the process or mechanism of acquiring all the properties and behaviour of one class to another.

The inheritance can be classified into two categories:
- subclass
- superclass

### subclass
> The subclass is a child class  and this class inherits from another class

### superclass
>The superclass is a parent class and this class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, we can use the **extends** keyword.
### Here is an example program for Inheritance
