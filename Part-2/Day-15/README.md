## OOPs

- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 
- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
  
### Advantages 

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## Types

- Objects
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
