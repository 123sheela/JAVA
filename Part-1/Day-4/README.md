# Java Learning - Day 4

## Welcome to this Day-4 directory!

> In this directory, I'm gonna explain about the process of runtime in a Java program

# Let's GoğŸš€

 - At runtime, the following steps are performed

## Let's learn about the JVM, JRE and JDK

 ### JVM

 > **JVM ( Java Virtual Machine)** is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment.

 - In this above image, the bytecode output of a java compiler is not executable code. 
 - Java compiler translates the **java source code into the byte code**, not the executable file. 
 - JVM takes the byte code and convert into the executable code corresponding to the Operating System. Due to this feature, **Java is Portable**.



### JRE

>  - **JRE - Java Runtime Environment** and  it can also written as **JRTE**.
>
> - It is a set of Software tools which is used for developing Java Applications.
> 
> - It is used to provide the Runtime Environment.

### JDK

> - **JDK - Java Development Kit**
> - The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a Software Development Environment which is used to develop Java Applications and Applets. It physically exists. 
> - It Contains **JRE + Development tools**.
