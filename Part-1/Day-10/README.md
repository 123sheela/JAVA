# Java Learning - Day 10

## Welcome to this Day-10 directory!

>  In this directory, I'm gonna explain about the **Control Statements** in Java.

## Control Statements:

Java provides 3 types of Control flow statements.
- Decision Making
- Loop Statements
- Jump Statements

# Let's learn about the Decision-Making statements in this directory.
## 1. Decision-Making Statements

> In these, Decision Making Statements decide **which statement to execute and when**.
It has 2 types.
- if statements
- switch statements

## 1. If Statement

In java, the **if** statement is used to evaluate a condition. The control of the program is diverted depending upon the specific condition. The condition of the **If** statement gives a **Boolean value, either True or False**.

## if-else Statement

The **if-else statement** is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code.

## if-else-if-ladder

The **if-else-if** statement contains the if-statement followed by multiple else-if statements. In other words, we can say that it is the chain of if-else statements that create a decision tree where the program may enter in the block of code where the condition is true.

## Nested if-statement

In **nested if-statements**, the if statement can contain a **if or if-else** statement inside another if or if-else statement.

## 2. Switch Statement

In java, **Switch statements** are similar to if-else-if statements. The switch statement contains multiple blocks of code called **cases** and a single **case** is executed based on the variable which is being switched.
