# Java Learning - Day 5

## Welcome to this Day-5 directory!

> In this directory, I'm going to explain about the **Variables** in Java.

# Let's Learn about the Variables ðŸš€

## Variables

 > A Variable is a Container which is used to **Store the Value** While the Java Program is executed.
 > A Variable is assigned with a data type.
 > A Variable is a name of Memory location.

  **There are three types of Variables in Java**
   - Local Variable
   - Instance Variable
   - Static Variable
  
 ### 1.Local Variable

 > A variable declared **inside the body of the method** is called the Local Variable.
 >
 > We can able to use this Variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the Variable exists.
 >
 > A loclal Variable cannot be defined with **static** Keyword.

  ### 2.Instance Variable

  > A Variable which is declared **inside the class but outside the body of the method** is called an Instance Variable.
  >
  > It is not declared as **static**.

  ### 3.Static Variable

  > A variable that is declared as **static** is called a Static Variable. 
  >
  > It cannot be local. We can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class.
