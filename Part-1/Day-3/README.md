# Java Learning - Day 3

## Welcome to this Day-3 directory!

> In this directory, I wanna share about the explanation of First Java Program - Hello World.

# Let's Start

  The basic structure of a Java Program would have the following Parts:

-   Documentation Section
-   Package Statement
-   Import Statements
-   Interface Statements
-   Class Definitions
-   Main Method class
-   Main Method definition.


> Before Starting to code, We need to know some basic information and syntax in Java.

# Syntax 
  
     class  HelloWorld 
     {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
     }

> The above mentioned syntax is the basic and important to run a program in Java. 

# Explanation

> **class** - It is a Keyword used to declare a class in Java. This class should be declared with a Name.
> 
> **public**  - Access Modifier (public means accessible from any other class).
> 
> **static**  - If we declare any method as static, there is no need to create an object to invoke the static method.
>
> **void** - It is the Return type of the method. It means it doesn't return any value.
>
> **main** - It represents the Entry point of the program
>
> **String[ ] args / String args[ ]** - Used for command line arguments.
>
> **System.out.println()** - It is used to print the statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the PrintStream class, println() is a method od the PrintStream class.
